This program serves to normalize the levels of audio files in a certain directory, using a GUI. PLease make sure that 
the FFMPEG package is either in your system PATH or in the same directory of the script, otherwise it will not be possible 
to process non .WAV files. You can find the download here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.
